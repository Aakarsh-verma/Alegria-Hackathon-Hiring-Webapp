An Hiring Manager web app made in PHP which uses random forest classifier in python to shortlist the cv's.

11. HR generates the empID and sends the joining kit remotely at the employees home address

## Softwares/Interfaces used:
1. PHP for webapp
2. Python for parsing and selecting cv's.
3. Python Packages for above: pyresparser(requires nltk and spacy), RandomForestClassifier from Sklearn. 
4. MySQL for database
